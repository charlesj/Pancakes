To do

* Rosylyn code analyzer in the build
* Convert commands to Events and Views?  Separate things?
* Internal Version Awareness
* Guards
* Json parser
* ELK Stack
	* Nlog implementation needs work.
* Prometheus.io for Telemetry and Metrics (Alerting?)
* All the tests
* Clock wrapper, or nodatime
* File wrapper
* Any other static wrappers?
* Configuration needs to be much much better.
* CoreOS
* Strongly Typed String Pattern
* User System
* Authorization on top
* CQRS? Maybe  Event sourcing for sure.  Materialized Views, core tech still to be determined.  Cassandra maybe?  Datomic unlikely (not open source).
* Remove Service Locator wrapper - it's likely not needed - Features get lost when it's wrapped.  If we're going to use it, let's use it.  
* Object Mapper should not be automapper
* Feature Flags
* Error Codes - Integrated nicely with logging. 
* EmberJS
* Full Test Runs
* CI of course
* Ansible
* How are services / tasks handled?
